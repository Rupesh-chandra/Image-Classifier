   Prerequisite :   Anaconda to run Jupyter Notebook
                    Python version = 3.8
                    Python library :

   Instruction : 
 
   Step 1 :  All the files should be saved in the same Directory. 
             If the files will be not in the same Directory you have to define the path of the file.

             For that you need to run : 
                                        pip install opencv-python
                                        pip install urllib.request
